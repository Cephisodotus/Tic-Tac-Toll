# Tic-Tac-Toll
Tic-Tac-Toe game based on Typing of the Dead

Very simple game built from scratch using C++ and the SLD2/SDL2_Image libraries.
Tic-Tac-Toe boards come at you and you have to win the board in order to survive. Ties and Losses count as a lost life.

Known bugs:
- Board will sometimes not clear when AI completes a match-3
- Memory leak with board deletion

Planned Improvements:
- Clearer "time limit" on finishing a board
- More variety in difficulty
- Lass abrupt board spawning/deletion
